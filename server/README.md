2. Configure the database in `.env`
3. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Architecture Overview

The project is structured into three layers:
- **Domain**: Contains entities, factories, validators, and repository interfaces.
- **Application**: Houses use cases that orchestrate business logic.
